    provide a positive experience for users. <a href="https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/1316548?hl=en"
      target="_blank">https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/1316548?hl=en</a></p>

  <h3>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h3>
  <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy
    policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and
    conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California
    consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and
    those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See more at: <a
      href="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf"
      target="_blank">http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</a>

  <p>Users can visit our site anonymously.</p>

    significant page after entering our website.</p>

  <li>On our Privacy Policy Page</li>

  <h3>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</h3>
  <p>It's also important to note that we do not allow third-party behavioral tracking.</p>
  <h3>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h3>
  <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's
    Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer
    protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do
    to protect children's privacy and safety online.</p>
  <p>We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.</p>
  <p>Do we let third-parties, including ad networks or plug-ins collect PII from children under 13?</p>
  <h3>Fair Information Practices</h3>
  <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts
    they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe.
    Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with
    the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>
  <h3>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data
    breach occur:</h3>
  <p>We will notify you via email within 7 business days.</p>
  <p>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue
    enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not
    only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts
    or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>
